## Reasons to always use encryption, data anonymization and MFA, alongside ML intrusion detection filters

1. Brute-force cracking. A simple password guessing script left to run indefinitely can eventually crack the user's password, provided the username is known either through social engineering, or guessing of the most common usernames. It will take longer if the password has special characters, and has more letters.
   An example is the script modified from @aghanathan which eventually cracks the password provided in index.html
   for(i=parseInt("aaaaaaaa", 36);i++<=parseInt("zzzzzzzz", 36);document.getElementById("password").value=i.toString(36)){console.log(i.toString(36));validateLogin();};
